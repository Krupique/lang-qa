      "###Context: We previously showed that fibrocytes, a hematopoietic stem cell source of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, infiltrated the colonic mucosa of a murine colitis model. We investigated whether fibrocytes were involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Human surgical intestinal specimens were stained with anti-leukocyte-specific protein 1 and anti-collagen type-I (ColI) antibodies. Circulating fibrocytes in the human peripheral blood were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting with anti-CD45 and anti-ColI antibodies. Cultured human fibrocytes were prepared by culturing peripheral CD14(+) monocytes. In the specimens of patients with Crohn's disease, the fibrocyte/total leukocyte percentage was significantly increased in inflammatory lesions (22.2 %, p < 0.01) compared with that in non-affected areas of the intestine (2.5 %). Interestingly, the percentage in fibrotic lesions was similar (2.2 %, p = 0.87) to that in non-affected areas. The percentages of circulating fibrocytes/total leukocytes were significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in healthy controls. Both CXC-chemokine receptor 4(+) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1(+) fibrocyte numbers were significantly increased in Crohn's disease, suggesting that circulating fibrocytes have a higher ability to infiltrate injured sites and traffic leukocytes. In cultured fibrocytes, lipopolysaccharide treatment remarkably upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA (17.0 ± 5.7-fold) and ColI mRNA expression (12.8 ± 5.7-fold), indicating that fibrocytes stimulated by bacterial components directly augmented inflammation as well as fibrosis.\n",
      "Output: Fibrocytes are recruited early in the inflammatory phase and likely differentiate into fibroblasts/myofibroblasts until the fibrosis phase. They may enhance inflammation by producing TNF-α and can directly augment fibrosis by producing ColI.\n",

However, since PEFT methods only add extra trainable parameters, this allows for training a quantized model with a PEFT adapter on top! Combining quantization with PEFT can be a good strategy to train even the largest models on a single GPU. For example, QLoRA is a method that quantizes a model to 4 bits and then trains it with LoRA. This method enables fine-tuning a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU, for instance.  \n",

Em vez de atualizar todos os milhões ou bilhões de parâmetros de um modelo, como acontece no *fine-tuning* tradicional, o PEFT se concentra em modificar uma porção mínima deles. Isso reduz a necessidade de recursos computacionais e de memória, mantendo o desempenho próximo ou equivalente ao do *fine-tuning* completo.\n",

    "Essas técnicas são úteis em casos onde se quer ajustar um modelo grande para tarefas específicas sem gastar muitos recursos. O PEFT é especialmente popular em modelos de linguagem natural (como *transformers*) devido ao seu custo-benefício e por possibilitar a adaptação de modelos muito grandes, como o GPT e o BERT, para múltiplas tarefas com eficiência.\n",

O LoRA é um dos métodos do *Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning* (PEFT) e é especialmente eficaz para economizar recursos computacionais e de memória.\n",

    "**Como o LoRA Funciona**\n",
    "\n",
    "O princípio do LoRA é usar uma decomposição de baixa dimensionalidade (ou *low-rank*) para modelar as alterações necessárias no modelo original. Em vez de ajustar diretamente os pesos principais de cada camada, o LoRA adiciona matrizes de baixa dimensionalidade para capturar as pequenas variações de pesos necessárias para a nova tarefa. Essas matrizes extras ajustam a saída do modelo de forma a adaptá-lo, enquanto os parâmetros originais permanecem congelados.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Redução de Recursos Computacionais**: Como apenas as matrizes de baixa dimensionalidade são treinadas, o uso de memória e de computação é muito menor do que em um ajuste completo.\n",
    "2. **Preservação do Conhecimento do Modelo**: Ao manter os parâmetros originais do modelo congelados, o LoRA preserva o conhecimento geral do pré-treinamento, adaptando-o com eficiência a uma nova tarefa sem modificar seu comportamento central.\n",
    "3. **Flexibilidade para Múltiplas Tarefas**: É possível treinar e armazenar várias matrizes LoRA para diferentes tarefas em um único modelo base, ativando-as conforme necessário. Isso permite uma adaptação rápida a várias tarefas sem a necessidade de *fine-tuning* completo para cada uma.\n",

    "\n",
    "PEFT, or *Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning*, is a fine-tuning approach designed to efficiently adjust large AI models by modifying only a small portion of their parameters. Instead of updating all the millions or billions of parameters in a model, as in traditional fine-tuning, PEFT focuses on modifying a minimal subset. This reduces computational and memory requirements while maintaining performance close to or equivalent to full fine-tuning.\n",

    "The most well-known PEFT techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adapters**: Insert additional layers between the model's original layers, training only these new layers. The original layers remain frozen, preserving pre-trained knowledge while allowing for lightweight, task-specific adjustments.\n",
    "2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Adds low-dimensional matrices that capture small changes in the model's parameters. LoRA is trained independently of the main layers, further reducing the resources required for adaptation.\n",
    "3. **Prefix Tuning**: Adds \"prefix\" vectors at the beginning of each attention layer in the model, altering how it processes input context. This enables effective fine-tuning without modifying the original parameters.\n",
    "4. **Prompt Tuning**: Instead of adjusting internal parameters, *Prompt Tuning* adds specific prompts or \"hooks\" to the model, guiding its responses toward a particular task.\n",
    "5. **BitFit**: Freezes all model layers and adjusts only the *bias terms* of the parameters. This drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining relatively good performance for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are useful when adjusting a large model for specific tasks without consuming excessive resources. PEFT is particularly popular in natural language processing models (such as *transformers*) due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to efficiently adapt very large models, like GPT and BERT, for multiple tasks.\n",

It allows the model to be adapted for a specific task by modifying only a small number of parameters instead of fine-tuning all millions or billions of them. LoRA is one of the methods within *Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning* (PEFT) and is particularly effective in reducing computational and memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How LoRA Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of LoRA is to use a low-dimensional decomposition (*low-rank*) to model the necessary changes in the original model. Instead of directly adjusting the main weights of each layer, LoRA adds low-dimensional matrices to capture the small weight variations required for the new task. These extra matrices adjust the model’s output, adapting it while keeping the original parameters frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Advantages of LoRA**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Computational Resources**: Since only the low-dimensional matrices are trained, memory and computational usage are much lower than in full fine-tuning.\n",
    "2. **Preserving the Model’s Knowledge**: By keeping the model’s original parameters frozen, LoRA preserves the general knowledge from pre-training while efficiently adapting it to a new task without modifying its core behavior.\n",

    "LoRA is widely used in natural language processing, particularly with large *transformer* models in tasks such as text classification, language generation, and language comprehension. It is also useful in computer vision and other fields where large models are applied.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **How QLoRA Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantization**: Quantization is the process of reducing the precision of model parameters (e.g., from 16-bit to 4-bit). This reduces the amount of memory required to store and process model weights, enabling large models to run on smaller GPUs. In QLoRA, the model is quantized carefully to minimize precision loss.\n",
    "2. **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: LoRA adds small low-dimensional matrices to the model's weights, training only these new parameters instead of updating the entire model. These matrices capture the necessary changes to adapt the model to a specific task, while the quantized weights remain frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these two methods, QLoRA leverages **quantization** to reduce memory usage while still enabling model adaptation using **LoRA**, without requiring updates to all parameters.\n",

    "#### **Key Advantages of QLoRA**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lower Memory and Compute Requirements**: With 4-bit quantization, the model takes up significantly less space in memory, allowing it to run on lower-capacity GPUs.\n",
    "2. **Efficient Training**: Only the low-rank adaptation matrices are trained, further reducing computational costs and accelerating the fine-tuning process.\n",
    "3. **Preserving Model Performance**: Despite quantization and partial parameter adaptation, QLoRA can maintain high accuracy, making it a viable alternative for fine-tuning very large models.\n",
